## üî® Task
To create a Content Management System that allows a user to track and edit information on an employee, their roles, departments and managers. This project utilizes Node.js, Inquirer and MySQL.

## üìé How to Use
Begin by running `npm start` in the Terminal. From here, a start screen will display with the title of the project, and a menu of choices available to you. 

Select one of these choices and you will either receive a table if you selected to view some information, or you will be prompted by the command line to enter information.

After each route is complete, you will be prompted again if you would like to continue using the application, but you are able to exit the program at any time.
